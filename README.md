## Development Philosophy

This project follows a structured development approach influenced by modern AI-assisted development practices:

### 1. Research Phase (Using ChatGPT O1 Preview)
Inspired by [CJ Vinay's AI Development Workflow](https://x.com/cj_zZZz/status/1855275550547521956), our research phase involves:
- Define core functionality: "I want to build a software that does x,y,z"
- Generate Project Requirements Document (PRD)
- Create dashboard and page layouts
- Document functionality specifications
- Develop application flow documentation

### 2. Design Phase (Using V0 by Vercel)
Following the workflow:
- Create new project structure
- Upload PRD, page layouts, and app flow docs
- Implement dashboard page design
- Code and save all page components
- Iterate on UI/UX elements

### 3. Structure Phase
- Engage [Claude](https://claude.ai/) for:
  - Project structure organization
  - Folder hierarchy setup
  - Documentation integration
  - Architecture planning

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Iterative development focusing on:
  - Strategy management implementation
  - Performance monitoring systems
  - User authentication flows
  - API integration
  - Manual code refinement and testing
