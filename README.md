  - Component design
  - Interactive effects
  - UI/UX integration

### 3. Structure Phase
- Engage Claude for:
  - Project structure organization
  - Folder hierarchy setup
  - Documentation integration
  - Architecture planning

### 4. Implementation Phase
- Iterative development focusing on:
  - Strategy management implementation
  - Performance monitoring systems
  - User authentication flows
  - API integration
  - Manual code refinement and testing
