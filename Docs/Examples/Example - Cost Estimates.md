# Monthly Running Cost Estimate

To estimate your monthly running cost, let’s break down the chosen apps and components:

## 1. Supabase
- **Pricing:**
  - **Free Tier:** Includes 500MB of database storage, 2GB bandwidth, and 50,000 monthly requests.
  - **Paid Tier:** $25/month for 8GB database storage, 50GB bandwidth, and 500,000 monthly requests.
  - Your 100 users with 1,000 reads/month equate to 100,000 reads, which fits comfortably into the $25 plan.
- **Estimated Cost:** $25/month.

## 2. Coolify
- **Pricing:**
  - Coolify is open-source and self-hosted, so the cost depends on the hosting provider.
  - **Typical hosting costs:**
    - VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS Lightsail): $10-$20/month for a small instance (2GB RAM, 1 vCPU) to host Coolify.
- **Estimated Cost:** ~$10-$20/month.

## 3. Plausible Analytics
- **Pricing:**
  - Self-hosted Plausible requires server hosting, similar to Coolify.
  - **Typical VPS costs:** $5-$10/month for lightweight usage (~100 users).
- **Estimated Cost:** ~$5-$10/month.

## 4. Prisma (Schema with Supabase)
- **Pricing:**
  - Prisma itself is free to use, but it relies on the Supabase PostgreSQL database.
  - Since you are already paying for Supabase, no additional cost is incurred here.

## 5. IBKR API
- **Pricing:**
  - IBKR API has no direct usage cost for basic API access but may incur costs depending on:
    - **Market data subscription fees:** $10-$40/month depending on the exchanges/data feeds required.
    - **Account balance requirements:** IBKR typically requires minimum funds (not a running cost).
- **Estimated Cost:** $10-$40/month for market data subscriptions.

## 6. Additional Factors to Consider
Here are potential factors that could increase your monthly costs:
- **Bandwidth Usage:** Supabase’s free and paid tiers include bandwidth, but excess usage may incur additional charges ($9 per 100GB). Ensure your application doesn’t overconsume bandwidth.
- **Data Storage:** Supabase’s 8GB storage may suffice for your use case. If additional storage is required, Supabase charges $0.125/GB/month.
- **Server Hosting Costs for Scaling:** If traffic grows, you may need higher-tier VPS hosting (e.g., $20-$40/month).
- **Email or Notification Services:** If your app uses email verification or notifications, consider services like Postmark or SendGrid (~$10/month).
- **SSL Certificates:** Most cloud providers include SSL certificates for free, but custom domains may incur costs (~$10-$20/year).

## Total Estimated Monthly Cost (for 100 Users, 100,000 Reads):

| **Component**         | **Cost Estimate**     |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Supabase              | $25/month            |
| Coolify Hosting       | $10-$20/month        |
| Plausible Hosting     | $5-$10/month         |
| IBKR Market Data      | $10-$40/month        |
| **Total**             | **$50-$95/month**    |

This range assumes you’re optimizing costs using VPS hosting for Plausible and Coolify.


# Version 1 - lesser detail given to chat agent 
To estimate the **cost of each solution** for a web app that uses Supabase for authentication, stock data storage, and transformation (with **1,000 monthly users** and **1,000 reads per user**), let's break down the components involved:

- **Supabase** for user authentication and database storage
- **Next.js** for the app, with its server-side capabilities (API routes, middleware)
- **Hosting** for both the frontend and backend (likely Vercel for Next.js)
- **Database storage costs** (Supabase's PostgreSQL)
- **Data transfer costs** (e.g., Supabase API calls for stock data)

### Assumptions:
- Each **user** performs **1,000 reads** per month.
- The reads are likely database **SELECT** queries (which are considered "reads").
- You will use **Supabase's free tier** for the first level and scale up as the app grows.
- The app is hosted on **Vercel** for frontend and backend, which offers generous free tiers for small projects.
- **Stock data** is stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL database) with some basic transformation logic executed server-side.

### **1. Supabase Costs:**

Supabase's pricing model includes several components:

- **Authentication**: Free for up to **50,000 active users** per month.
- **Database** (PostgreSQL):
  - **Free tier**: 500 MB of database storage, 2 GB of file storage.
  - Paid plans (for higher usage):
    - **Basic**: $25/month for 8 GB of database storage.
    - **Pro**: $75/month for 20 GB of database storage.
    - Additional reads/writes cost more, based on the number of requests.
- **API Calls/Reads**: Supabase charges for the number of **reads**, **writes**, and **storage usage** (for tables and files).

#### **Authentication Costs**:
- **Free** tier includes up to **50,000 active users** and covers your 1,000 users easily.
  - **Cost**: **Free** for authentication.

#### **Database Costs**:
- **Reads**: Each query is a "read" operation in Supabase. On the **free tier**, you're limited to **500,000 requests** per month (including reads and writes). 
  - For 1,000 users with 1,000 reads per user: 
    - **1,000 users x 1,000 reads = 1,000,000 reads** per month.
  - Since the free tier provides **500,000 reads**, you'll need to upgrade to the **Basic Plan** at $25/month.
  - **Cost for database reads**: On the **Basic Plan**, the first 8 GB of storage and **500,000 reads** are included. Additional reads above that will incur additional charges, but you likely won't reach that threshold with 1,000 users unless your stock data queries are very large.
  
#### **Total Supabase Costs** for 1,000 monthly users:
- **Authentication**: **Free** (within the limit).
- **Database (Basic Plan)**: $25/month (for database storage, API requests, and transformations).
  
### **2. Vercel Hosting Costs (Frontend + Backend):**

Vercel offers generous free tiers for small applications.

- **Free Tier**:
  - **Serverless Functions**: Up to **100 GB-hours** of compute time.
  - **Requests**: Up to **100,000 requests** per month.
  - **Bandwidth**: 100 GB of bandwidth.
  - **Storage**: Free for static hosting.
  
Given that you're using Next.js API routes and serverless functions for stock data processing, it’s highly likely that you will stay within the **free tier** unless you have very high traffic or large payloads.

#### **Total Vercel Costs** for 1,000 monthly users:
- **Frontend and API routes**: **Free** (unless you exceed the limits mentioned above).

### **3. Data Transfer Costs (Supabase to Vercel):**

- **Data transfer**: Supabase provides **5 GB** of free data transfer per month (for both reads and writes).
- Each **API call** (e.g., fetching stock data) will incur some data transfer costs.
  - Assuming each read is about **1 KB** in size (typical for small queries), **1,000,000 reads** would transfer around **1 GB** of data.
  - Since you're under the **5 GB transfer limit** on the free tier, the data transfer costs will also be **free** unless you exceed that.

#### **Total Data Transfer Costs**:
- **Free** (under the 5 GB free data transfer for Supabase).

### **4. Stock Data Transformation Costs (Server-side Logic):**

- **Serverless function execution** (Vercel functions) is billed based on compute time and the number of executions. Each request that transforms or processes stock data will be counted as an API call on Vercel.
  
  - **Compute time**: If each stock data transformation takes about **200 ms**, then for **1,000,000 reads**, the total compute time would be about **200,000 seconds (or ~55 hours)** of serverless function compute time.
  - The **Vercel free tier** provides **100 GB-hours** of compute time. With **55 hours** of compute time, you're still within the free limits.
  
  So, **stock data transformation** is likely **free** under Vercel's free tier unless the logic becomes more complex or the data grows significantly in size.

### **Summary of Costs:**

| **Service**          | **Monthly Cost**               |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Supabase Authentication** | Free (under 50,000 active users) |
| **Supabase Database (Basic Plan)** | $25/month (for 1,000,000 reads, 8 GB storage) |
| **Vercel Hosting**         | Free (within free tier limits)   |
| **Data Transfer (Supabase)** | Free (under 5 GB transfer limit)  |
| **Stock Data Transformation (Vercel)** | Free (within 100 GB-hours compute time) |

#### **Total Estimated Monthly Cost**: **$25/month**

### Key Considerations:
1. **Supabase Database Usage**: If the stock data becomes more complex or grows in size, you might exceed the **8 GB storage** or **500,000 reads** on the **Basic Plan**, resulting in higher costs.
2. **Vercel Free Tier**: The **100,000 requests** per month and **100 GB of bandwidth** should be more than enough for 1,000 users with relatively light stock data operations. If your app grows or gets more traffic, Vercel offers paid plans, but they are generally quite affordable.
3. **Scaling**: If you scale up to **10,000 users** or more, you'll need to account for more reads (10 million), which will increase your Supabase costs significantly. At that point, Supabase Pro ($75/month) might be more appropriate, and you may also exceed Vercel's limits.

### Final Thought:
For an app with **1,000 users** and **1,000 reads per user**, your **estimated monthly cost** for **Supabase** and **Vercel** would be around **$25/month**, primarily due to the **Supabase database** costs for managing the stock data. If you scale beyond this, the costs will increase proportionally, especially with larger databases or more complex serverless operations.
