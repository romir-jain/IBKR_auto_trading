### How to Incorporate **Plausible Analytics** Into Your Code for Free

You can use **Plausible Analytics** for free by either hosting it yourself or using their hosted service with a free trial. Below are the two main approaches to incorporate Plausible into your project:

### 1. **Using the Hosted Plausible Analytics (Paid Option with a Free Trial)**
You can sign up for the hosted version of Plausible Analytics on their website, which is a paid service but offers a **30-day free trial**.

#### Steps:
1. **Sign Up for Plausible**:
   - Visit [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) and create an account.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to add a website to your Plausible account.
   
2. **Add Plausible Analytics Script to Your Site**:
   - After creating your account and adding your site, Plausible will provide a script that you need to embed in your website.
   - You typically add this script inside the `<head>` tag of your HTML file, like so:

   ```html
   <script async defer data-domain="yourdomain.com" src="https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js"></script>
   ```

   Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.

3. **Verify**: After adding the script, check your Plausible dashboard to see if data is being sent correctly.

**Note**: Plausible will start tracking visitors once the script is integrated, and you can access reports directly from their hosted dashboard.

### 2. **Self-hosting Plausible Analytics (Free Option)**

Plausible is open-source, so you can **self-host** it for free. This is a great option if you want to avoid ongoing costs and have control over your data.

#### Requirements to Host Plausible Yourself:
- **A server** (can be a cloud server, your own VPS, or even a local machine for development).
- **Docker** (to run Plausible in containers).
- **Domain** (optional, but recommended for proper configuration and SSL).

#### Steps to Self-Host Plausible:

##### Step 1: Clone Plausible’s GitHub Repository
Plausible’s source code is available on GitHub. You can easily self-host it using Docker.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plausible/analytics.git
cd analytics
```

##### Step 2: Set Up Docker
Make sure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your server. If not, follow these installation guides:
- [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

##### Step 3: Configure Environment
Plausible requires a few environment variables for configuration (e.g., database credentials, domain name, etc.).

1. Inside the Plausible repo, create a `.env` file from the template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file and modify it to suit your setup (e.g., your database details and domain). For example:
   - `DOMAIN=yourdomain.com`
   - Set up your PostgreSQL credentials.

##### Step 4: Launch Plausible Analytics
Now, using Docker Compose, you can set up and start Plausible Analytics.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will run Plausible in the background using Docker containers. You can check the logs to make sure everything is running properly.

##### Step 5: Configure DNS & SSL (Optional)
For production, you might want to:
- Point a custom domain (e.g., `analytics.yourdomain.com`) to your server.
- Set up SSL certificates using **Let's Encrypt** for HTTPS.

Plausible’s documentation has a [guide on setting up SSL with Let's Encrypt](https://plausible.io/docs/self-hosting).

##### Step 6: Access Plausible Analytics Dashboard
Once everything is set up, you can access the Plausible dashboard by going to the URL of your self-hosted instance, e.g., `http://yourdomain.com`.

### 3. **Adding the Plausible Script to Your Website (for Self-hosting)**

After you’ve set up Plausible, you can integrate the tracking script into your website similarly to the hosted version. The script to add will look like this:

```html
<script async defer data-domain="yourdomain.com" src="https://yourdomain.com/js/plausible.js"></script>
```

This is the same as the hosted version, but you’re pointing to your self-hosted instance.

### 4. **Verifying and Using Plausible Analytics**

Once you add the script, you can check your dashboard to see if Plausible is collecting data. It may take a few minutes for the first metrics to show up.

Plausible offers a simple dashboard where you can:
- View real-time traffic.
- Track sources of traffic (e.g., search engines, social media).
- Monitor user behavior, including page views, bounce rate, and events (if you’ve set up event tracking).

### Conclusion

- **Free Option (Self-hosted)**: If you want to host Plausible yourself, you can do so for free. You’ll need a server (e.g., VPS or cloud instance) and some basic Docker setup. Once set up, you’ll have full control over the data, and Plausible will be free to use.
  
- **Paid Option (Hosted)**: If you prefer a hassle-free experience and don’t want to worry about server maintenance, you can use the hosted version of Plausible with a free 30-day trial. After that, it's a paid service.

In both cases, adding Plausible to your website is simple—just add a small JavaScript snippet to your HTML `<head>` and start tracking visitors in a privacy-respecting way!
